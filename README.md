# LCOM  
The report explains the LCOM project in detail (in case you're interested).  
To compile and run the game:  
- cd to the **src/** directory  
- write **make clean && make**  
- **lcom_run proj "<path_to_the_resources_directory> <video_mode>"**.
It should be noted that these command line arguments are optional.  

# MINIX image  
The MINIX image used as been added to the repository for preservation
(if something fails in the future, run the image without internet connection).

This project was developed with my good friend [Jo√£o Lucas](https://github.com/joaolucasmartins).  
I also promissed my friend [Ana](https://github.com/anaines14) that I'd
give her a place in the credits (as a joke) for an idea we discussed
so here it is.
